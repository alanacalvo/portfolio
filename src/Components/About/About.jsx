          <p>Hi, my names Alana and I build things for the web. It took me a long time to get here though. I could never figure out what it was that I wanted to do in life. I spent my time with my kids, and doing various jobs that I enjoyed, and some that I did not. It wasn't until there were over three people that I knew as software engineers, that I decided to check it out and see if it was for me too. Turns out it was, and now here I am. I am thrilled to be a part of the ever growing tech field.</p>
            
            <p>I currently work as a freelance developer, and I am a proud graduate of General Assembly's Sofwate Engineering Immersive Boot Camp. ADD LINK HERE ? </p>

          <p>In my free time, you can find me hanging out with family and friends, binge watching movie and shows, or exploring a new city.</p>
