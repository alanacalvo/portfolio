          <p>Hi, I'm Alana and I enjoy creating functional, beautiful, and efficient applications. It took me a long time to get here though. I could never figure out what it was that I wanted to do in life. I spent my time with my kids, and working various jobs that I enjoyed, and some that I did not. It wasn't until three people in my circle became software engineers, that I decided to check it out and see if it was for me too. Turns out it was, and now here I am, doing something that I absolutely love. I am thrilled to be a part of the ever growing tech field.</p>
            
            <p>I currently work as a freelance developer, and I am a proud graduate of General Assembly's Sofwate Engineering Immersive Boot Camp. I am open to hearing about other opportunities, so feel free to reach out!</p>

          <p>In my free time, you can find me hanging out with family and friends, binge watching movie and shows, or exploring a new city.</p>
